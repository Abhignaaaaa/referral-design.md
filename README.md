# Referral Platform Design

**Cover Letter:**

Dear Internship Reviewer,

I am excited to submit the design for our referral-based business platform. The design is split into two primary sections: the **Business Side** and the **Referrer Side**. This modular approach ensures clarity in both administrative tasks and user engagement, streamlining workflows for both businesses and referrers.

**Design Rationale:**

- **Modular Structure:** Dividing the platform into two sides helps to focus on both administrative and user-facing tasks, ensuring an intuitive flow.
- **User-Centric Flow:** The Business Side provides easy access to key features such as AI assistance, CRM, analytics, and campaign management. The Referrer Side offers a streamlined, engaging experience for quick sharing and referral tracking.
- **Scalability & Integration:** Features like Zapier integration and automated reward verification support scalability and seamless third-party integrations.
- **AI-Enhanced Interactions:** Leveraging AI for task management and sharing suggestions enhances user efficiency and engagement.
